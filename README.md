# [ABTN0105] Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis---Capstone-Project
We’ve got this Google Playstore’s apps data.  One of the columns is called ‘Rating’, which is an average score given to each app.  I wanted to see what influences the higher or the lower rating for the apps.  For example, there are columns like ‘Type’, which can identify if a given app is either Free or Paid. I wonder if this matters when it comes to the apps rating scores.  There are other columns like Review counts, Install counts, Review comment’s sentimen scores, etc. and I’d like to see if these have any correlated relationships with the rating score.
